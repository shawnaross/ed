Sonnet 1

- From fairest creatures we desire increase, 
- That thereby beauty’s rose might never die, 
- But as the riper should by time decease, 
- His tender heir might bear his memory: 
- But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes, 
- Feed’st thy light’st flame with self-substantial fuel, 
- Making a famine where abundance lies, 
- Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel. 
- Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament 
- And only herald to the gaudy spring, 
- Within thine own bud buriest thy content 
- And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding. 
- {:.indent-2} Pity the world, or else this glutton be, 
- {:.indent-2} To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.
